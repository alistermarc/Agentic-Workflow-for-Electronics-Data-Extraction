This single Schmitt-trigger buffer is designed for 1.65-V to 5.5-V Vcc operation.

The SN74LVC1G17 device contains one buffer and performs the Boolean function Y = A.

The CMOS device has high output drive while maintaining low static power dissipation over a broad Vcc operating range.

The SN74LVC1G17 is available in a variety of packages, including the ultra-small DPW package with a body size of 0.8 mm x 0.8mm.

## 8 Detailed Description

## 8.1 Overview

The SN74LVC1G17 device contains one Schmitt trigger buffer and performs the Boolean function Y = A. The device functions as an independent buffer, but because of Schmitt action, it will have different input threshold levels for a positive-going (VT+) and negative-going signals.

The DPW package technology is a major breakthrough in IC packaging. Its tiny 0.64 mm square footprint saves significant board space over other package options while still retaining the traditional manufacturing friendly lead pitch of 0.5 mm.

This device is fully specified for partial-power-down applications using lof. The lof circuitry disables the outputs, preventing damaging current backflow through the device when it is powered down.

## 8.2 Functional Block Diagram

## 8.3 Feature Description

- ¢ Wide operating voltage range.
- — Operates From 1.65 V to 5.5 V.
- + Allows Down voltage translation.
- * Inputs accept voltages to 5.5 V.
- * lof feature allows voltages on the inputs and outputs, when Vcc is 0 V.

## 9 Applications and Implementation

## Note

Information in the following applications sections is not part of the Tl component specification, and TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. Tl's customers are responsible for determining suitability of components for their purposes. Customers should validate and test their design implementation to confirm system functionality.

## 9.1 Application Information

The SN74LVC1G17 is a high drive CMOS device that can be used for a multitude of buffer type functions where the input is slow or noisy. It can produce 24 mA of drive current at 3.3 V making it Ideal for driving multiple outputs and good for high speed applications up to 100 MHz. The inputs are 5.5 V tolerant allowing it to translate down to Vcc.

## 9.2 Typical Application

<!-- image -->

## 9.2.1 Design Requirements

This device uses CMOS technology and has balanced output drive. Care should be taken to avoid bus contention because it can drive currents that would exceed maximum limits. The high drive will also create fast edges into light loads so routing and load conditions should be considered to prevent ringing.

## 9.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure

- 1. Recommended Input Conditions
- * Rise time and fall time specs. See (At/AV) in the Recommended Operating Conditions table.
- Specified high and low levels. See (Vjy and Vj.) in the Recommended Operating Conditions table.
- Inputs are overvoltage tolerant allowing them to go as high as (V, max) in the Recommended Operating Conditions table at any valid Vcc .

## 2. Recommend Output Conditions

- Load currents should not exceed (Io max) per output and should not exceed (continuous current through Vec or GND) total current for the part. These limits are located in the Absolute Max Ratings table.
- * Outputs should not be pulled above Vcc.

## 9.2.3 Application Curves

## 10 Power Supply Recommendations

The power supply can be any voltage between the min and max supply voltage rating located in the Recommended Operating Conditions table.

Each Vcc pin should have a good bypass capacitor to prevent power disturbance. For devices with a single supply a 0.1-uF capacitor is recommended and if there are multiple Vcc pins then a 0.01-uF or 0.022-y"F capacitor is recommended for each power pin. It is ok to parallel multiple bypass caps to reject different frequencies of noise. 0.1-"F and 1-uF capacitors are commonly used in parallel. The bypass capacitor should be installed as close to the power pin as possible for best results.

## 11 Layout

## 11.1 Layout Guidelines

When using multiple bit logic devices inputs should not ever float. In many cases, functions or parts of functions of digital logic devices are unused, for example, when only two inputs of a triple-input AND gate are used or only 3 of the 4 buffer gates are used. Such input terminals should not be left unconnected because the undefined voltages at the outside connections result in undefined operational states. Specified below are the rules that must be observed under all circumstances. All unused inputs of digital logic devices must be connected to a high or low bias to prevent them from floating. The logic level that should be applied to any particular unused input depends on the function of the device. Generally they will be tied to Gnd or Vcc whichever make more sense or is more convenient.

## 12.2 Electrostatic Discharge Caution

<!-- image -->

This integrated circuit can be damaged by ESD. Texas Instruments recommends that all integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures can cause damage.

ESD damage can range from subtle performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage because very small parametric changes could cause the device not to meet its published specifications.

- ) Material type: When designated, preproduction parts are prototypes/experimental devices, and are not yet approved or released for full production. Testing and final process, including without limitation quality assurance, reliability performance testing, and/or process qualification, may not yet be complete, and this item is subject to further changes or possible discontinuation. If available for ordering, purchases will be subject to an additional waiver at checkout, and are intended for early internal evaluation purposes only. These items are sold without warranties of any kind.
- ®) RoHS values: Yes, No, RoHS Exempt. See the T! RoHS Statement for additional information and value definition.
- Lead finish/Ball material: Parts may have multiple material finish options. Finish options are separated by a vertical ruled line. Lead finish/Ball material values may wrap to two lines if the finish value exceeds the maximum column width.
- MSL rating/Peak reflow: The moisture sensitivity level ratings and peak solder (reflow) temperatures. In the event that a part has multiple moisture sensitivity ratings, only the lowest level per JEDEC standards is shown. Refer to the shipping label for the actual reflow temperature that will be used to mount the part to the printed circuit board.
- © part marking: There may be an additional marking, which relates to the logo, the lot trace code information, or the environmental category of the part.

Multiple part markings will be inside parentheses. Only one part marking contained in parentheses and separated by a "~" will appear on a part. If a line is indented then it is a continuation of the previous line and the two combined represent the entire part marking for that device.
