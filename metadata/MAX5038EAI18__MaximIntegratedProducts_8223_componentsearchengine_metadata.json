The MAX5038/MAX5041 utilize a dual-phase, average current-mode control that enables optimal use of low Rps(ONn) MOSFETs, eliminating the need for external heatsinks even when delivering high output currents.\\n\\nDifferential sensing enables accurate control of the output voltage, while adaptive voltage positioning provides optimum transient response. An internal regulator enables operation with input voltage ranges of +4.75V to +5.5V or +8V to +28V. The high switching frequency, up to 500kHz per phase, and dual-phase operation allow the use of low-output inductor values and input capacitor values. This accommodates the use of PC boardembedded planar magnetics achieving superior reliability, current sharing, thermal management, compact size, and low system cost.\\n\\nThe MAX5038/MAX5041 also feature a clock input (CLKIN) for synchronization to an external clock, and a clock output (CLKOUT) with programmable phase delay (relative to CLKIN) for paralleling multiple phases. The MAX5038 offers a variety of factory-trimmed preset output voltages (see Selector Guide) and the MAX5041 offers an adjustable output voltage from +1.0V to +3.3V.\\n\\nThe MAX5038/MAX5041 operate over the extended industrial temperature range (-40°C to +85°C) and are available in a 28-pin SSOP package. Refer to the MAX5037 data sheet for a VRM 9.0-compatible, VIDcontrolled output voltage controller in a 44-pin MQFP or QFN package.\\n\\nApplications\\n\\nServers and Workstations\\n\\nPoint-Of-Load High-Current/High-Density Telecom DC-DC Regulators\\n\\nNetworking Systems\\n\\nLarge-Memory Arrays\\n\\nRAID Systems\\n\\nHigh-End Desktop Computers\\n\\nMAXIM\\n\\n- @ +4.75V to +5.5V or +8V to +28V Input Voltage Range\\n- Up to 60A Output Current o-?¢\\n- Internal Voltage Regulator for a +12V or +24V Power Bus\\n- True Differential Remote Output Sensing o-?-\\n- Two Out-Of-Phase Controllers Reduce Input Capacitance Requirement and Distribute Power Dissipation\\n- @ Average Current-Mode Control\\n- Superior Current Sharing Between Individual Phases and Paralleled Modules\\n- Accurate Current Limit Eliminates MOSFET and Inductor Derating\\n- ¢ Integrated 4A Gate Drivers\\n- @ Selectable Fixed Frequency 250kHz or 500kHz Per Phase (Up to 1MHz for 2 Phases)\\n- @ Fixed (MAX5038) or Adjustable (MAX5041) Output Voltages\\n- ¢# 0.5% Accurate Reference (MAX5041B)\\n- ¢@ External Frequency Synchronization from 125kHz to 600kHz\\n- ¢ Internal PLL with Clock Output for Paralleling Multiple DC-DC Converters\\n- # Thermal Protection\\n- # 28-Pin SSOP Package\\n\\nOrdering Information\\n\\n| PART          | TEMP RANGE     | PIN- PACKAGE   | OUTPUT VOLTAGE     |\\n|---------------|----------------|----------------|--------------------|\\n| MAX5038 EAI12 | -40¡C to +85¡C | 28 SSOP        | Fixed +1.2V        |\\n| MAX5038EAI15  | -40¡C to +85¡C | 28 SSOP        | Fixed +1.5V        |\\n| MAX5038EAI18  | -40¡C to +85¡C | 28 SSOP        | Fixed +1.8V        |\\n| MAX5038EAI25  | -40¡C to +85¡C | 28 SSOP        | Fixed +2.5V        |\\n| MAX5038EAI33  | -40¡C to +85¡C | 28 SSOP        | Fixed +3.3V        |\\n| MAX5041 EAI   | -40¡C to +85¡C | 28 SSOP        | Adj +1.0V to +3.3V |\\n| MAX5041BEAI   | -40¡C to +85¡C | 28 SSOP        | Adj +1.0V to +3.3V |\\n\\nPin Configuration appears at end of data sheet.\\n\\nMaxim Integrated Products\\n\\n1\\n## Dual-Phase, Parallelable, Average Current-Mode Controllers\\n## ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM RATINGS\\n\\nIN to SGND\\n\\n-0.3V to +30V\\n\\nBST\\\\_ to SGND.\\n\\n0.3V to +35V\\n\\nDH\\\\_ to LX\\\\_\\n\\n.-0.3V to [(VBsT\\\\_ - VLx\\\\_) + 0.3V]\\n\\nDL\\\\_to PGND..\\n\\n..-0.3V to (Vcc + 0.3V)\\n\\nBST\\\\_ to LX\\\\_\\n\\n0.3V to +6V\\n\\nVcc to SGND..\\n\\n0.3V to +6V\\n\\nVcc to PGND..\\n\\n0.3V to +6V\\n\\nSGND to PGND.\\n\\n.3V to +0.3V\\n\\nAll Other Pins to SGND...........\\n\\neee\\n\\n-0.3V to (Vcc + 0.3V)\\n\\nContinuous Power Dissipation (Ta = +70°C)\\n\\n28-Pin SSOP (derate 9.5mW/°C above +70°C)\\n\\n............\\n\\n762mW\\n\\nOperating Temperature Range\\n\\n...\\n\\n--40°C to +85°C\\n\\nMaximum Junction Temperature\\n\\n...........:ccececeeeteeeeeeeeeee\\n\\n+150°C\\n\\nStorage Temperature Range.......\\n\\n60°C to +150°C\\n\\nLead Temperature (soldering, 10s)\\n\\n+300°C\\n\\nStresses beyond those listed under \\\"Absolute Maximum Ratings\\\" may cause permanent damage to the device.

The MAX5038/MAX5041 utilize a single controlling VEA and an average current mode to force the phase currents to be equal.\\n\\n![Image](MAX5038EAI18__MaximIntegratedProducts_8223_componentsearchengine-with-image-refs_artifacts/image_000040_bb89eb7efb3aff75d188b418c5afb46bd84cf23ac66d9de2a08e62d48d94f076.png)\\n\\nFigure 2.

All internal control circuitry operates from an internally regulated nominal voltage of +5V (Vcc). For input voltages of +8V or greater, the internal Vcc regulator steps the voltage down to +5V. The Vcc output voltage regulates to +5V while sourcing up to 80mA. Bypass Vcc to SGND with 4.7uF and 0.1yF low-ESR ceramic capacitors for highfrequency noise rejection and stable operation (Figures 1 and 2).\\n\\nCalculate power dissipation in the MAX5038/MAX5041 as a product of the input voltage and the total Vcc regulator output current (Icc). Icc includes quiescent current (Iq) and gate drive current (IDD):\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\nwhere, Qa1, Qa2, Qa3, and Qqq are the total gate charge of the low-side and high-side external MOSFETs, Iq is 4mA (typ), and fsw is the switching frequency of each individual phase.\\n\\nFor applications utilizing a +5V input voltage, disable the Vcc regulator by connecting IN and Vcc together.\\n\\nUndervoltage Lockout (UVLO)/ Power-On Reset (POR)/Soft-Start\\n\\nThe MAX5038/MAX5041 include an undervoltage lockout with hysteresis and a power-on reset circuit for converter turn-on and monotonic rise of the output voltage. The UVLO threshold is internally set between +4.0V and +4.5V with a 200mV hysteresis. Hysteresis at UVLO eliminates \\\"chattering\\\" during startup.\\n\\nMost of the internal circuitry, including the oscillator, turns on when the input voltage reaches +4V. The MAX5038/MAX5041 draw up to 4mA of current before the input voltage reaches the UVLO threshold.\\n\\nThe compensation network at the current error amplifiers (CLP1 and CLP2) provides an inherent soft-start of the output voltage. It includes a parallel combination of capacitors (C28, C30) and resistors (R5, R6) in series with other capacitors (C27, C29) (see Figures 1 and 2). The voltage at CLP\\\\_ limits the maximum current available to charge output capacitors. The capacitor on CLP\\\\_ in conjunction with the finite output-drive current of the current-error amplifier yields a finite rise time for the output current and thus the output voltage.\\n\\nThe internal oscillator generates the 180° out-of-phase clock signals required by the pulse-width modulation (PWM) circuits. The oscillator also generates the 2Vp-p voltage ramp signals necessary for the PWM comparators. Connect CLKIN to SGND to set the internal oscillator frequency to 250kHz or connect CLKIN to Vcc to set the internal oscillator to 5SOOkHz.\\n\\nCLKIN is a CMOS logic clock input for the phaselocked loop (PLL). When driven externally, the internal oscillator locks to the signal at CLKIN. A rising edge at CLKIN starts the ON cycle of the PWM. Ensure that the external clock pulse width is at least 200ns. CLKOUT provides a phase-shifted output with respect to the rising edge of the signal at CLKIN. PHASE sets the amount of phase shift at CLKOUT. Connect PHASE to Vcc for 120° of phase shift, leave PHASE unconnected for 90° of phase shift, or connect PHASE to SGND for 60° of phase shift with respect to CLKIN.\\n\\nThe MAX5038/MAX5041 require compensation on PLLCMP even when operating from the internal oscillator. The device requires an active PLL in order to generate the proper clock signal required for PWM operation.\\n\\nControl Loop\\n\\nThe MAX5038/MAX5041 use an average current-mode control scheme to regulate the output voltage (Figures 3a and 3b). The main control loop consists of an inner current loop and an outer voltage loop. The inner loop controls the output currents (IPHASE1 and IPHASE2) while the outer loop controls the output voltage. The inner current loop absorbs the inductor pole reducing the order of the outer voltage loop to that of a singlepole system.\\n\\nThe current loop consists of a current-sense resistor (Rs), a current-sense amplifier (CA\\\\_), a current-error amplifier (CEA\\\\_), an oscillator providing the carrier ramp, and a PWM comparator (CPWIV\\\\_). The precision CA\\\\_ amplifies the sense voltage across Rs by a factor of 18. The inverting input to the CEA\\\\_ senses the CA\\\\_ output. The CEA\\\\_ output is the difference between the voltage-error amplifier output (EAOUT) and the gainedup voltage from the CA\\\\_. The RC compensation network connected to CLP1 and CLP2 provides external frequency compensation for the respective CEA\\\\_. The start of every clock cycle enables the high-side drivers and initiates a PWM ON cycle. Comparator CPWM\\\\_ compares the output voltage from the CEA\\\\_ with a 0 to +2V ramp from the oscillator. The PWM ON cycle terminates when the ramp voltage exceeds the error voltage.\\n## Dual-Phase, Parallelable, Average Current-Mode Controllers\\n\\nFigure 3a.

The unity-gain differential amplifier provides true differential remote sensing of the output voltage. The differential amplifier output connects to the inverting input (EAN) of the VEA. The noninverting input of the VEA is internally connected to an internal precision reference voltage. The MAX5041 reference voltage is set to +1.0V and the MAX5038 reference is set to the preset output voltage. The VEA controls the two inner current loops (Figures 3a and 3b). Use a resistive feedback network to set the VEA gain as required by the adaptive voltage-positioning circuit (see the Adaptive Voltage Positioning section).\\n## Current-Sense Amplifier\\n\\nThe differential current-sense amplifier (CA\\\\_) provides a DC gain of 18. The maximum input offset voltage of the current-sense amplifier is 1mV and the common-mode voltage range is -0.3V to +3.6V. The current-sense amplifier senses the voltage across a current-sense resistor.\\n## Peak-Current Comparator\\n\\nthan the average current limit (48mV). Proper inductor selection ensures that only extreme conditions trip the peak-current comparator, such as a cracked output inductor. The 112mV voltage threshold for triggering the peak-current limit is twice the full-scale average current-limit voltage threshold. The peak-current comparator has a delay of only 260ns.\\n## Current-Error Amplifier\\n\\nEach phase of the MAX5038/MAX5041 has a dedicated transconductance current-error amplifier (CEA\\\\_) with a typical gm of 550uS and 320A output sink and source current capability. The current-error amplifier outputs, CLP1 and CLP2, serve as the inverting input to the PWM comparator. CLP1 and CLP2 are externally accessible to provide frequency compensation for the inner current loops (Figures 3a and 3b). Compensate CEA\\\\_ such that the inductor current down slope, which becomes the up slope to the inverting input of the PWM comparator, is less than the slope of the internally generated voltage ramp (see the Compensation section).\\n## PWM Comparator and R-S Flip-Flop\\n\\nThe peak-current comparator provides a path for fast cycle-by-cycle current limit during extreme fault conditions such as an output inductor malfunction (Figure 4). Note that the average current-limit threshold of 48mV still limits the output current during short-circuit conditions. To prevent inductor saturation, select an output inductor with a saturation current specification greater\\n\\nThe PWM comparator (CPWM) sets the duty cycle for each cycle by comparing the output of the current-error amplifier to a 2Vp-p ramp. At the start of each clock cycle, an R-S flip-flop resets and the high-side driver (DH\\\\_) turns on. The comparator sets the flip-flop as soon as the ramp voltage exceeds the CLP\\\\_ voltage, thus terminating the ON cycle (Figure 4).\\n\\n![Image](MAX5038EAI18__MaximIntegratedProducts_8223_componentsearchengine-with-image-refs_artifacts/image_000045_76085431fe961f5779fabec62f24d43359767c8826881a844d6bbdcda5e537e0.png)\\n\\nFigure 4.

It provides true differential output voltage sensing while rejecting the common-mode voltage errors due to highcurrent ground paths. Sensing the output voltage directly at the load provides accurate load voltage sensing in high-current environments. The VEA provides the difference between the differential amplifier output (DIFF) and the desired output voltage. The differential amplifier has a bandwidth of 3MHz. The difference between SENSE+ and SENSEregulates to the preset output voltage for the MAX5038 and regulates to +1V for the MAX5041.\\n## Voltage-Error Amplifier\\n\\nThe VEA sets the gain of the voltage control loop and determines the error between the differential amplifier output and the internal reference voltage (VREF).\\n\\nVREF equals VOUT(NOM) for the +1.8V or lower voltage versions of the MAX5038 and VREF equals VOUT(NOM)/2 for the +2.5V and +3.3V versions. For MAX5041, VREF equals +1V.\\n\\nAn offset is added to the output voltage of the MAX5038/MAX5041 with a finite gain (RF/RIN) of the VEA such that the no-load output voltage is higher than the nominal value. Choose Rr and RIN from the Adaptive Voltage Positioning section and use the following equations to calculate the no-load output voltage.\\n\\nMAX5038:\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\nMAX5041 :\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\nwhere RH and RL are the feedback resistor network (Figure 2).\\n\\nSome applications require VouT equal to VoUT(NOM) at no load. To ensure that the output voltage does not exceed the nominal output voltage (VOUT(NOM)), add a resistor Rx from Vcc to EAN.\\n\\nUse the following equations to calculate the value of Rx. For MAX5038 versions of VOUT(NOM) $ +1.8V:\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\nFor MAX5038 versions of VOUT(NOM) &gt; +1.8V:\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\nFor MAX5041:\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\nThe VEA output clamps to +0.9V (plus the commonmode voltage of +0.6V), thus limiting the average maximum current from individual phases. The maximum average current-limit threshold for each phase is equal to the maximum clamp voltage of the VEA divided by the gain (18) of the current-sense amplifier. This allows for accurate settings for the average maximum current for each phase. Set the VEA gain using Rr and Rin for the amount of output voltage positioning required as discussed in the Adaptive Voltage Positioning section (Figures 3a and 3b).\\n## Adaptive Voltage Positioning\\n\\nPowering new-generation processors requires new techniques to reduce cost, size, and power dissipation. Voltage positioning reduces the total number of output capacitors to meet a given transient response requirement. Setting the no-load output voltage slightly higher than the output voltage during nominally loaded conditions allows a larger downward voltage excursion when the output current suddenly increases. Regulating at a lower output voltage under a heavy load allows a larger upward-voltage excursion when the output current suddenly decreases. A larger allowed, voltage-step excursion reduces the required number of output capacitors or allows for the use of higher ESR capacitors.\\n\\nVoltage positioning and the ability to operate with multiple reference voltages may require the output to regulate away from a center value. Define the center value as the voltage where the output drops (AVouT/2) at one half the maximum output current (Figure 5).\", \"## Dual-Phase, Parallelable, Average Current-Mode Controllers\\n\\n![Image](MAX5038EAI18__MaximIntegratedProducts_8223_componentsearchengine-with-image-refs_artifacts/image_000047_94ca43539a1873c3032e52397cca2f1ac86bec67f4648700cd216467e673095e.png)\\n\\nPhase-Locked Loop: Operation and Compensation\\n\\nFigure 5.

Connecting CLKIN to Vcc or SGND forces the PWM frequency to default to the internal oscillator frequency of 500kHz or 250kHz, respectively. The PLL uses a conventional architecture consisting of a phase detector and a charge pump capable of providing 20uA of output current. Connect an external series combination capacitor (C25) and resistor (R4) and a parallel capacitor (C26) from PLLCMP to SGND to provide frequency compensation for the PLL (Figure 1). The pole-zero pair compensation provides a zero at fz = 1 / [R4 x (C25 + C26)] and a pole at fp = 1 / (R4 x C26). Use the following typical values for compensating the PLL: R4 = 7.5kQ, C25 = 4.7nF, C26 = 470pF. If changing the PLL frequency, expect a finite locking time of approximately 200s.\\n\\nThe MAX5038/MAX5041 require compensation on PLLCMP even when operating from the internal oscillator. The device requires an active PLL in order to generate the proper internal PWM clocks.\\n\\nMOSFET Gate Drivers (DH\\\\_, DL\\\\_) The high-side (DH\\\\_) and low-side (DL\\\\_) drivers drive the gates of external N-channel MOSFETs (Figures 1 and 2). The drivers' high-peak sink and source current capability provides ample drive for the fast rise and fall times of the switching MOSFETs. Faster rise and fall times result in reduced cross-conduction losses. For modern CPU voltage-regulating module applications where the duty cycle is less than 50%, choose highside MOSFETs (Q1 and Q3) with a moderate Rps(on) and a very low gate charge. Choose low-side MOSFETs (Q2 and Q4) with very low Rps(on) and moderate gate charge.\\n\\nThe driver block also includes a logic circuit that provides an adaptive non-overlap time to prevent shootthrough currents during transition. The typical non-overlap time is 60ns between the high-side and low-side MOSFETs.\\n\\nBST.\\n\\nVpp powers the lowand high-side MOSFET drivers. Connect a 0.47yF low-ESR ceramic capacitor between BST\\\\_ and LX\\\\_. Bypass Vcc to PGND with 4.7uF and 0.1pF low-ESR ceramic capacitors. Reduce the PC board area formed by these capacitors, the rectifier diodes between Vcc and the boost capacitor, the MAX5038/MAX5041, and the switching MOSFETs.\\n## Dual-Phase, Parallelable, Average Current-Mode Controllers\\n\\nOverload Conditions\\n\\nAverage current-mode control has the ability to limit the average current sourced by the converter during a fault condition. When a fault condition occurs, the VEA output clamps to +0.9V with respect to the common-mode voltage (Vcm = +0.6V) and is compared with the output of the current-sense amplifiers (CA1 and CA2) (see Figures 3a and 3b). The current-sense amplifier's gain of 18 limits the maximum current in the inductor or sense resistor to ILIMIT = 50mV/Rs.\\n## Parallel Operation\\n\\nFor applications requiring large output current, parallel up to three MAX5038/MAX5041s (six phases) to triple the available output current. The paralleled converters operate at the same switching frequency but different phases keep the capacitor ripple RMS currents to a minimum. Three parallel MAX5038/MAX5041 converters deliver up to 180A of output current. To set the phase shift of the on-board PLL, leave PHASE unconnected for 90° of phase shift (2 paralleled converters), or connect PHASE to SGND for 60° of phase shift (3 converters in parallel). Designate one converter as master and the remaining converters as slaves. Connect the master and slave controllers in a daisy-chain configuration as shown in Figure 6. Connect CLKOUT from the master controller to CLKIN of the first slaved controller, and CLKOUT from the first slaved controller to CLKIN of the second slaved controller. Choose the appropriate phase shift for minimum ripple currents at the input and output capacitors. The master controller senses the output differential voltage through SENSE+ and SENSEand generates the DIFF voltage. Disable the voltage sensing of the slaved controllers by leaving DIFF unconnected (floating). Figure 7 shows a detailed typical parallel application circuit using two MAX5038s. This circuit provides four phases at an input voltage of +12V and an output voltage range of +1V to +3.3V at 104A.\\n## Applications Information\\n\\nEach MAX5038/MAX5041 circuit drives two 180° out-ofphase channels. Parallel two or three MAX5038/ MAX5041 circuits to achieve fouror six-phase operation, respectively. Figure 1 shows the typical application circuit for a two-phase operation. The design criteria for a two-phase converter includes frequency selection, inductor value, input/output capacitance, switching MOSFETs, sense resistors, and the compensation network. Follow the same procedure for the fourand sixphase converter design, except for the input and output capacitance. The input and output capacitance requirements vary depending on the operating duty cycle.\\n\\nThe examples discussed in this data sheet pertain to a typical application with the following specifications:\\n\\nVin\\n\\n= +12V\\n\\nVout =\\n\\n+1.8V\\n\\nlout(max)\\n\\n=\\n\\n52A\\n\\nfgw =\\n\\n250kHz\\n\\nPeak-to-Peak Inductor Current (Al\\\\_) = 10A\\n\\nTable 1 shows a list of recommended external components (Figure 1) and Table 2 provides component supplier information.\\n\\nNumber of Phases\\n\\nSelecting the number of phases for a voltage regulator depends mainly on the ratio of input-to-output voltage (operating duty cycle). Optimum output-ripple cancellation depends on the right combination of operating duty cycle and the number of phases. Use the following equation as a starting point to choose the number of phases:\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\nwhere K = 1, 2, or 3 and the duty cycle is D = Vout/Vin.\\n\\nChoose K to make Npuw an integer number. For example, converting Vin = +12V to Vout = +1.8V yields better ripple cancellation in the six-phase converter than in the four-phase converter. Ensure that the output load justifies the greater number of components for multiphase conversion. Generally limiting the maximum output current to 25A per phase yields the most costeffective solution. The maximum ripple cancellation occurs when Npy = K/D.\\n\\nSingle-phase conversion requires greater size and power dissipation for external components such as the switching MOSFETs and the inductor. Multiphase conversion eliminates the heatsink by distributing the power dissipation in the external components. The multiple phases operating at given phase shifts effectively increase the switching frequency seen by the input/output capacitors, thereby reducing the input/output capacitance requirement for the same ripple performance. The lower inductance value improves the large-signal response of the converter during a transient load at the output. Consider all these issues when determining the number of phases necessary for the voltage regulator application.\\n\\nInductor Selection\\n\\nThe switching frequency per phase, peak-to-peak ripple current in each phase, and allowable ripple at the output determine the inductance value.\\n\\n![Image](MAX5038EAI18__MaximIntegratedProducts_8223_componentsearchengine-with-image-refs_artifacts/image_000049_12dcfb24311d8f68efb69ea638a7f0bf3ff37716a172f00aa9d7995951b79bb7.png)\\n## Dual-Phase, Parallelable, Average Current-Mode Controllers\\n\\n![Image](MAX5038EAI18__MaximIntegratedProducts_8223_componentsearchengine-with-image-refs_artifacts/image_000050_2dcfc3b13e7475b29e6cd16fa006bd2d62ba07cd652a08255ad1f615c2961805.png)\\n\\nFigure 6.

The charge/discharge cycle of the gate and drain capacitances in the switching MOSFETs create switching losses.

Use 500kHz per phase for Vin = +5V and 250kHz or less per phase for Vin &gt; +12V.\\n\\nAlthough lower switching frequencies per phase increase the peak-to-peak inductor ripple current (AIL), the ripple cancellation in the multiphase topology reduces the input and output capacitor RMS ripple current.\\n\\nUse the following equation to determine the minimum inductance value:\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\nChoose Al, equal to about 40% of the output current per phase.

See the Vin and Vcc section to determine the maximum total gate charge allowed from all the driver outputs together.\\n\\nThe gate charge and drain capacitance (CV2) loss, the cross-conduction loss in the upper MOSFET due to finite rise/fall time, and the I2R loss due to RMS current in the MOSFET Rogion) account for the total losses in the MOSFET. Estimate the power loss (PDmos\\\\_) in the high-side and low-side MOSFETs using following equations:\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\nwhere Qe, Rpscon), tr, and tr are the upper-switching MOSFET's total gate charge, on-resistance at +25°C, rise time, and fall time, respectively.\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\nwhere D = Vout/Vin, Ipc = (lout -AlL)/2 and Ipk = (lout + AlL)/2\\n## Dual-Phase, Parallelable, Average Current-Mode Controllers\\n\\nPDmos-Lo =(Qg * Vop x fsw)+\\n\\nInput Capacitors\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\nFor example, from the typical specifications in the Applications Information section with Vout = +1.8V, the high-side and low-side MOSFET RMS currents are 9.9A and 24.1A, respectively.

The switching frequency, peak inductor current, and the allowable peak-to-peak voltage ripple reflected back to the source dictate the capacitance requirement. Increasing the number of phases increases the effective switching frequency and lowers the peak-to-average current ratio, yielding lower input capacitance requirement.\\n\\nThe input ripple is comprised of AVq (caused by the capacitor discharge) and AVesr (caused by the ESR of the capacitor). Use low-ESR ceramic capacitors with high ripple-current capability at the input. Assume the contributions from the ESR and capacitor discharge are equal to 30% and 70%, respectively. Calculate the input capacitance and ESR required for a specified ripple using the following equation:\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\nwhere lout is the total output current of the multiphase converter and N is the number of phases.\\n\\nFor example, at Vout = +1.8V, the ESR and input capacitance are calculated for the input peak-to-peak ripple of 100mvV or less yielding an ESR and capacitance value of 1mQ and 200pF.\\n## Output Capacitors\\n\\nThe worst-case peak-to-peak and capacitor RMS ripple current, the allowable peak-to-peak output ripple voltage, and the maximum deviation of the output voltage during step loads determine the capacitance and the ESR requirements for the output capacitors.\\n\\nIn multiphase converter design, the ripple currents from the individual phases cancel each other and lower the ripple current. The degree of ripple cancellation depends on the operating duty cycle and the number of phases. Choose the right equation from Table 3 to calculate the peak-to-peak output ripple for a given duty cycle of two-, four-, and six-phase converters. The maximum ripple cancellation occurs when Ney = K/ D.\\n## Dual-Phase, Parallelable, Average Current-Mode Controllers\\n\\nThe allowable deviation of the output voltage during the fast transient load dictates the output capacitance and ESR. The output capacitors supply the load step until the controller responds with a greater duty cycle. The response time (tREsPoNseE) depends on the closed-loop bandwidth of the converter. The resistive drop across the capacitor ESR and capacitor discharge causes a voltage drop during a step load. Use a combination of SP polymer and ceramic capacitors for better transient load and ripple/noise performance.\\n\\nKeep the maximum output voltage deviation less than or equal to the adaptive voltage-positioning window (AVout). Assume 50% contribution each from the output capacitance discharge and the ESR drop. Use the following equations to calculate the required ESR and capacitance value:\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\nwhere Istep is the load step and tresponse is the response time of the controller. Controller response time depends on the control-loop bandwidth.\\n## Current Limit\\n\\nThe average current-mode control technique of the MAX5038/MAX5041 accurately limits the maximum output current per phase. The MAX5038/MAX5041 sense the voltage across the sense resistor and limit the peak inductor current (I\\\\_-px) accordingly. The ON cycle terminates when the current-sense voltage reaches 45mV (min). Use the following equation to calculate maximum current-sense resistor value:\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\nwhere PDr is the power dissipation in sense resistors. Select 5% lower value of Rsense to compensate for any parasitics associated with the PC board. Also, select a non-inductive resistor with the appropriate wattage rating.\\n\\nCompensation\\n\\nThe main control loop consists of an inner current loop and an outer voltage loop. The MAX5038/MAX5041 use an average current-mode control scheme to regulate the output voltage (Figures 3a and 3b). IpHase1 and IpHasE2 are the inner average current loops. The VEA output provides the controlling voltage for these current sources. The inner current loop absorbs the inductor pole reducing the order of the outer voltage loop to that of a single-pole system.\\n\\nA resistive feedback around the VEA provides the best possible response, since there are no capacitors to charge and discharge during large-signal excursions, RF and Rin determine the VEA gain. Use the following equation to calculate the value for Rr:\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\nwhere Gc is the current-loop gain and N is number of phases.\\n\\nWhen designing the current-control loop ensure that the inductor downslope (when it becomes an upslope at the CEA output) does not exceed the ramp slope. This is a necessary condition to avoid sub-harmonic oscillations similar to those in peak current-mode control with insufficient slope compensation. Use the following equation to calculate the resistor Ror:\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\nFor example, the maximum RPcr is 12kQ for Rsense = 1.35mQ.\\n\\nCcr provides a low-frequency pole while Rcr provides a midband zero. Place a zero at fz to obtain a phase bump at the crossover frequency. Place a high-frequency pole (fp) at least a decade away from the crossover frequency to achieve maximum phase margin.\\n## Dual-Phase, Parallelable, Average Current-Mode Controllers\\n\\nUse the following equations to calculate Ccr and Ccrr:\\n\\nPin Configuration\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\nPC Board Layout\\n\\nUse the following guidelines to layout the switching voltage regulator.\\n\\n- 1) Place the Vin and Vcc bypass capacitors close to the MAX5038/MAX5041.\\n- 2) Minimize the high-current loops from the input capacitor, upper switching MOSFET, inductor, and output capacitor back to the input capacitor negative terminal.\\n- 3) Keep short the current loop from the lower switching MOSFET, inductor, and output capacitor and return to the source of the lower MOSFET.\\n- 4) Place the Schottky diodes close to the lower MOSFETs and on the same side of the PC board.\\n- 5) Keep the SGND and PGND isolated and connect them at one single point close to the negative terminal of the input filter capacitor.\\n- 6) Run the current-sense lines CS+ and CSvery close to each other to minimize the loop area. Similarly, run the remote voltage sense lines SENSE+ and SENSEclose to each other. Do not cross these critical signal lines through power circuitry. Sense the current right at the pads of current-sense resistors.\\n- 7) Avoid long traces between the Vcc bypass capacitors, driver output of the MAX5038/MAX5041, MOSFET gates and PGND pin. Minimize the loop formed by the Vcc bypass capacitors, bootstrap diode, bootstrap capacitor, MAX5038/MAX5041, and upper MOSFET gate.\\n- 8) Place the bank of output capacitors close to the load.\\n- 9) Distribute the power components evenly across the board for proper heat dissipation.\\n- 10) Provide enough copper area at and around the switching MOSFETs, inductor, and sense resistors to aid in thermal dissipation.\\n- 11) Use at least 40z copper to keep the trace inductance and resistance to a minimum. Thin copper PC boards can compromise efficiency since high currents are involved in the application. Also, thicker copper conducts heat more effectively, thereby reducing thermal impedance.\\n\\n![Image](MAX5038EAI18__MaximIntegratedProducts_8223_componentsearchengine-with-image-refs_artifacts/image_000056_9871dcb34c62c5989914c02b2658c069f551ddaf79eb78fd1615681ed654cd78.png)\\n\\nChip Information\\n\\nTRANSISTOR COUNT: 5431\\n\\nPROCESS: BiCMOS\", \"## Dual-Phase, Parallelable, Average Current-Mode Controllers\\n\\nPackage Information\\n\\n(The package drawing(s) in this data sheet may not reflect the most current specifications.
