Each channel of the product consists  of  a  low  noise  preamplifier  (LNP)  and  a  Variable Gain Amplifier (VGA). The LNP circuit provides the necessary  connections  to  implement  Active  Termination  (AT),  a method  of  cable  termination  which  results  in  up  to  4.6dB noise figure improvement. Different cable termination characteristics can be accommodated by utilizing the VCA2612's switchable LNA feedback pins. The LNP has the ability to accept both differential and single-ended inputs, and generates a differential output signal. The LNP provides strappable gains of 5dB, 17dB, 22dB, and 25dB.\\n\\nThe output of the LNP can be accessed externally for further signal processing, or fed directly into the VGA. The VCA2612's VGA section  consists  of  two  parts:  the  Voltage  Controlled Attenuator  (VCA)  and  the  Programmable  Gain  Amplifier (PGA). The gain and gain range of the PGA can be digitally programmed. The combination of these two programmable elements results in a variable gain ranging from 0dB up to a maximum  gain  as  defined  by  the  user  through  external connections. The output of the VGA can be used in either a single-ended or differential mode to drive high-performance Analog-to-Digital (A/D) converters.\\n\\nThe  VCA2612  also  features  low  crosstalk  and  outstanding distortion performance. The combination of low noise and gain range programmability make the VCA2612 a versatile building block in a number of applications where noise performance is critical. The VCA2612 is available in a TQFP-48 package.\\n\\n![Image](VCA2612Y_slash_250__TexasInstruments_183_componentsearchengine-with-image-refs_artifacts/image_000002_a7d5529df1126cf075c89781918c1730cfe617890c5a2f50fdd36b9093376827.png)\\n\\n![Image](VCA2612Y_slash_250__TexasInstruments_183_componentsearchengine-with-image-refs_artifacts/image_000003_000240511f9456bb123d6661a404490de2b3fa1c0f309efbe95235e70fd5393e.png)\\n\\nPlease  be  aware  that  an  important  notice  concerning  availability,  standard  warranty,  and  use  in  critical  applications  of Texas Instruments semiconductor products and disclaimers thereto appears at the end of this data sheet.\\n\\nAll trademarks are the property of their respective owners.\\n\\n![Image](VCA2612Y_slash_250__TexasInstruments_183_componentsearchengine-with-image-refs_artifacts/image_000004_a48b5c56b8110f42dbc24dd6cdbd2308ea08fb77f347bedc9a0b1fe64e422809.png)\\n\\nCopyright © 2000-2004, Texas Instruments Incorporated\\n## ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM RATINGS (1)\\n\\nPower Supply (+V S ) ............................................................................. +6V\\n\\nAnalog Input ............................................................. - .3V to (+V\\n\\n0 S + 0.3V)\\n\\nLogic Input ............................................................... - .3V to (+V\\n\\n0 S + 0.3V)\\n\\nCase Temperature ......................................................................... +100\\n\\n° C\\n\\nJunction Temperature .................................................................... +150\\n\\n° C\\n\\nStorage Temperature ...................................................... -0\\n\\n4 ° C to +150 C °\\n\\nNOTE:  (1)  Stresses  above  these  ratings  may  cause  permanent  damage.

For  greater  system  flexibility,  an  onboard multiplexer is provided for the VCA inputs, selecting either the LNP outputs or external signal inputs. Figure 1 shows a simplified block diagram of the dual-channel system.\\n\\nFIGURE 1. Simplified Block Diagram of the VCA2612.\\n\\n![Image](VCA2612Y_slash_250__TexasInstruments_183_componentsearchengine-with-image-refs_artifacts/image_000055_55936254534d80640db6bca13e9e814f4d37372b68adb8fb76270cdefcd95282.png)\\n## LNP-OVERVIEW\\n\\nThe LNP input may be connected to provide active-feedback signal  termination,  achieving  lower  system  noise  performance  than  conventional  passive  shunt  termination.  Even lower noise performance is obtained if signal termination is not  required.  The  unterminated  LNP  input  impedance  is 600k Ω . The  LNP  can  process  fully  differential  or  singleended signals in each channel. Differential signal processing results in significantly reduced 2nd-harmonic distortion and improved rejection of common-mode and power supply noise. The first gain stage of the LNP is AC-coupled into its output buffer with a 44 µ s time constant (3.6kHz high-pass characteristic). The buffered LNP outputs are designed to drive the succeeding VCA directly or, if desired, external loads as low as 135 Ω with minimal impact on signal distortion. The LNP employs  very  low  impedance  local  feedback  to  achieve stable  gain  with  the  lowest  possible  noise  and  distortion. Four  pin-programmable  gain  settings  are  available:  5dB, 17dB, 22dB, and 25dB. Additional intermediate gains can be programmed by adding trim resistors between the Gain Strap programming pins.\\n\\nThe common-mode DC level at the LNP output is nominally 2.5V, matching the input common-mode requirement of the VCA for simple direct coupling. When external signals are fed to the VCA, they should also be set up with a 2.5VDC common-mode level. Figure 2 shows a circuit that demonstrates the recommended coupling method using an external op  amp.  The V CM   node  shown  in  the  drawing  is  the  V CM output (pin 19). Typical R and C values are shown, yielding a  high-pass  time  constant  similar  to  that  of  the  LNP.  If  a different  common-mode  referencing  method  is  used,  it  is important that the common-mode level be within 10mV of the VCM output for proper operation.\\n\\nFIGURE 2. Recommended Circuit for Coupling an External Signal into the VCA Inputs.\\n\\n![Image](VCA2612Y_slash_250__TexasInstruments_183_componentsearchengine-with-image-refs_artifacts/image_000056_1885e177d678e0d37971098e56a1c4bcbf6aa84da1d58e02dcd54ad4cb8db0ae.png)\\n## VCA-OVERVIEW\\n\\nThe magnitude of the differential VCA input signal (from the LNP or an external source) is reduced by a programmable attenuation  factor,  set  by  the  analog  VCA  Control  Voltage (VCACNTL)  at  pin  43.  The  maximum  attenuation  factor  is further programmable by using the three MGS bits (pins 4042).  Figure  3  illustrates  this  dual-adjustable  characteristic. Internally,  the  signal  is  attenuated  by  having  the  analog VCACNTL  vary  the  channel  resistance  of  a  set  of  shuntconnected FET transistors. The MGS bits effectively adjust the  overall  size  of  the  shunt  FET  by  switching  parallel components  in  or  out  under  logic  control.  At  any  given maximum gain setting, the analog variable gain characteristic is linear in dB as a function of the control voltage, and is created as a piecewise approximation of an ideal dB-linear transfer function. The VCA gain control circuitry is common to both channels of the VCA2612.\\n\\n![Image](VCA2612Y_slash_250__TexasInstruments_183_componentsearchengine-with-image-refs_artifacts/image_000057_bb730751e399de507dcd65b316c6014248b5e86244e953ea75210baa7e4abe21.png)\\n\\nFIGURE 3. Swept Attenuator Characteristic.\\n\\n![Image](VCA2612Y_slash_250__TexasInstruments_183_componentsearchengine-with-image-refs_artifacts/image_000058_539e65e689e59b15aee9f1d6dc6a2fcb4b2b01c4635831e98b6d32ba626ac6cd.png)\\n## PGA OVERVIEW AND OVERALL DEVICE CHARACTERISTICS\\n\\nThe differential output of the VCA attenuator is then amplified by the PGA circuit block. This post-amplifier is programmed by  the  same  MGS  bits  that  control  the  VCA  attenuator, yielding an overall swept-gain amplifier characteristic in which the VCA ·  PGA gain varies from 0dB (unity) to a programmable peak gain of 24dB, 27dB, 30dB, 33dB, 36dB, 39dB, 42dB, or 45dB.\\n\\nThe GAIN vs VCACNTL curve on page 4 shows the composite gain  control  characteristic  of  the  entire  VCA2612.  Setting VCACNTL to 3.0V causes the digital MGS gain control to step in  3dB  increments.  Setting  VCA CNTL to  0V  causes  all  the MGS-controlled gain curves to converge at one point. The gain  at  the  convergence  point  is  the  LNP  gain  less  6dB, because the measurement setup looks at only one side of the  differential  PGA  output,  resulting  in  6dB  lower  signal amplitude.\\n## ADDITIONAL FEATURES-OVERVIEW\\n\\nOverload protection stages are placed between the attenuator  and  the  PGA,  providing  a  symmetrically  clipped  output whenever the input becomes large enough to overload the PGA.  A  comparator  senses  the  overload  signal  amplitude and  substitutes  a  fixed  DC  level  to  prevent  undesirable overload recovery effects. As with the previous stages, the VCA is AC-coupled into the PGA. In this case, the coupling time constant varies from 5 µ s at the highest gain (45dB) to 59 µ s at the lowest gain (25dB).\\n\\nThe VCA2612 includes a built-in reference, common to both channels, to supply a regulated voltage for critical areas of the  circuit.  This  reduces  the  susceptibility  to  power  supply variation,  ripple,  and  noise.  In  addition,  separate  power supply and ground connections are provided for each channel and for the reference circuitry, further reducing interchannel cross-talk.\\n\\nFurther  details  regarding  the  design,  operation  and  use  of each circuit block are provided in the following sections.\", \"## LOW NOISE PREAMPLIFIER (LNP)-DETAIL\\n\\nThe LNP is designed to achieve a low noise figure, especially when employing active termination. Figure 4 is a simplified schematic of the LNP, illustrating the differential  input  and output  capability.  The  input  stage  employs  low  resistance local  feedback  to  achieve  stable  low  noise,  low  distortion performance with very high input impedance. Normally, low noise  circuits  exhibit  high  power  consumption  due  to  the large bias currents required in both input and output stages. The LNP uses a patented technique that combines the input and  output  stages  such  that  they  share  the  same  bias current. Transistors Q 4 and Q 5 amplify the signal at the gatesource input of Q 4 , the +IN side of the LNP. The signal is further amplified by the Q  and Q  stage, and then by the final 1 2 Q3 and RL gain stage, which uses the same bias current as the input devices Q 4 and Q 5 . Devices Q 6 through Q 10 play the same role for signals on the - IN side.\\n\\nThe differential gain of the LNP is given in Equation (1):\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\n![Image](VCA2612Y_slash_250__TexasInstruments_183_componentsearchengine-with-image-refs_artifacts/image_000059_c0fe39c1e437d7c324c8eb493af0b6512122ce5ac9640c4a7b3e7139ac90ce3c.png)\\n\\nFIGURE 4.

The connections for various R S  combinations are brought out to device pins LNPG S1 , LNPG S2, and LNPGS3 (pins 13-15 for channel A, 22-24 for channel B). These Gain Strap pins allow the user to establish one of four fixed LNP gain options as shown in Table I.\\n\\nTABLE I. Pin Strappings of the LNP for Various Gains.\\n\\n| LNP PIN STRAPPING                              |   LNP GAIN (dB) |\\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\\n| LNPG S1 , LNPG S2 , LNPG S3 Connected Together |              25 |\\n| LNPG S1 Connected to LNPG S3                   |              22 |\\n| LNPG S1 Connected to LNPG S2                   |              17 |\\n| All Pins Open                                  |               5 |\\n\\nIt is also possible to create other gain settings by connecting an  external  resistor  between  LNPG S1   on  one  side,  and LNPGS2  and/or  LNPGS3  on  the  other.  In  that  case,  the internal  resistor  values  shown  in  Figure  4  should  be  combined  with  the  external  resistor  to  calculate  the  effective value of R S for use in Equation (1). The resulting expression for external resistor value is given in Equation (2).\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\nwhere REXT is the externally selected resistor value needed to achieve the desired gain setting, R S1 is the fixed parallel resistor in Figure 4, and R FIX is the effective fixed value of the remaining internal resistors: R S2 , R S3 , or (R S2  || R S3 ) depending on the pin connections.\\n\\nNote that the best process and temperature stability will be achieved by using the pre-programmed fixed gain options of Table I, since the gain is then set entirely by internal resistor ratios, which are typically accurate to ± 0.5%, and track quite well over process and temperature. When combining external resistors with the internal values to create an effective R S value, note that the internal resistors have a typical temperature coefficient of +700ppm/ C and an absolute value toler-° ance of approximately ± 5%, yielding somewhat less predictable and stable gain settings. With or without external resistors, the board layout should use short Gain Strap connections to minimize parasitic resistance and inductance effects.\\n\\nTo preserve the low noise performance of the LNP, the user should take care to minimize resistance in the input lead. A parasitic resistance of only 10 Ω will contribute 0.4nV/ √ Hz.\\n\\nTABLE II. Noise Performance for MGS = 111 and VCA CNTL = 3.0V.\\n\\n|               | NOISE (nV/ √ Hz)   | NOISE (nV/ √ Hz)   |\\n|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|\\n| LNP GAIN (dB) | Input-Referred     | Output-Referred    |\\n| 25            | 1.54               | 2260               |\\n| 22            | 1.59               | 1650               |\\n| 17            | 1.82               | 1060               |\\n| 5             | 4.07               | 597                |\\n\\nThe LNP is capable of generating a 2V PP  differential signal. The  maximum  signal  at  the  LNP  input  is  therefore  2V PP divided  by  the  LNP  gain.  An  input  signal  greater  than  this would  exceed  the  linear  range  of  the  LNP,  an  especially important consideration at low LNP gain settings.\\n## ACTIVE FEEDBACK WITH THE LNP\\n\\nOne of the key features of the LNP architecture is the ability to  employ  active-feedback  termination  to  achieve  superior noise performance. Active feedback termination achieves a lower noise figure than conventional shunt termination, essentially because no signal current is wasted in the termination  resistor  itself.  Another  way  to  understand  this  is  as follows: Consider first that the input source, at the far end of the signal cable has a cable-matching source resistance of RS. Using conventional shunt termination at the LNP input, a second  terminating  resistor  of  value  R S is  connected  to ground. Therefore, the signal loss is 6dB due to the voltage divider  action  of  the  series  and  shunt  R S resistors.  The effective source resistance has been reduced by the same factor of 2, but the noise contribution has been reduced by only the √ 2, only a 3dB reduction. Therefore, the net theoretical SNR degradation is 3dB, assuming a noise-free amplifier input.  (In  practice,  the  amplifier  noise  contribution  will  degrade both the unterminated and the terminated noise figures, somewhat reducing the distinction between them.)\\n\\nThe overall noise performance of the VCA2612 will vary as a  function  of  gain.  Table  II  shows  the  typical  input-  and output-referred  noise  densities  of  the  entire  VCA2612  for maximum VCA and PGA gain; i.e., VCA CNTL  set to 3.0V and all  MGS  bits  set  to 1.  Note  that  the  input-referred  noise values include the contribution of a 50 Ω fixed source impedance, and are therefore somewhat larger than the intrinsic input noise. As the LNP gain is reduced, the noise contribution  from  the  VCA/PGA  portion  becomes  more  significant, resulting in higher input-referred noise. However, the outputreferred noise, which is indicative of the overall SNR at that gain setting, is reduced.\\n\\nSee  Figure  5  for  an  amplifier  using  active  feedback.  This diagram appears very similar to a traditional inverting amplifier.  However,  the  analysis  is  somewhat  different  because the gain A in this case is not a very large open-loop op amp gain; rather, it is the relatively low and controlled gain of the LNP  itself.  Thus,  the  impedance  at  the  inverting  amplifier terminal will be reduced by a finite amount, as given in the familiar relationship of Equation (3):\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\nwhere  R F is  the  feedback  resistor  (supplied  externally  between the LNP IN P and FB terminals for each channel), A is the user-selected gain of the LNP, and R IN  is the resulting amplifier input impedance with active feedback. In this case, unlike  the  conventional  termination  above,  both  the  signal voltage and the R S noise are attenuated by the same factor\\n\\n![Image](VCA2612Y_slash_250__TexasInstruments_183_componentsearchengine-with-image-refs_artifacts/image_000061_4fa91277d9b4753390d9da0103a1847a9c740b1fd4cd501a7f8b9bff616da626.png)\\n\\nFIGURE 5.

This avoids the extra 3dB degradation due to the square-root effect  described  above,  the  key  advantage  of  the  active termination technique.\\n\\nAs mentioned above, the previous explanation ignored the input  noise  contribution  of  the  LNP  itself.  Also,  the  noise contribution of the feedback resistor must be included for a completely correct analysis. The curves given in Figures 6 and 7 allow the VCA2612 user to compare the achievable noise figure for active and conventional termination methods. The left-most set of data points in each graph give the results for  typical  50 Ω cable  termination,  showing  the  worst  noise figure but also the greatest advantage of the active feedback method.\\n\\nFIGURE 6. Noise Figure for Active Termination.\\n\\n![Image](VCA2612Y_slash_250__TexasInstruments_183_componentsearchengine-with-image-refs_artifacts/image_000063_da6c15bf71718a5f2fa53163f615085e674caf66cfbbb0859a6ec306825997ab.png)\\n\\nFIGURE 7.

The two different values  of  feedback  resistance  will  result  in  two  different values of active-feedback input resistance. Thus, the activefeedback impedance can be optimized at two different LNP gain settings. The switch is connected at the buffered output of the LNP and has an ON resistance of approximately 1 Ω .\\n\\nWhen employing active feedback, the user should be careful to  avoid  low-frequency  instability  or  overload  problems. Figure 8 illustrates the various low-frequency time constants. Referring again to the input resistance calculation of Equation (3), and considering that the gain term A falls off below 3.6kHz, it is evident that the effective LNP input impedance will rise below 3.6kHz, with a DC limit of approximately R . F To  avoid  interaction  with  the  feedback  pole/zero  at  low frequencies, and to avoid the higher signal levels resulting from the rising impedance characteristic, it is recommended that the external R C C F time constant be set to about 5 µ s.\\n\\n![Image](VCA2612Y_slash_250__TexasInstruments_183_componentsearchengine-with-image-refs_artifacts/image_000065_2e1da329478730952bde69e74ae26bb42989b4943c388680ca7b8f2b774c4f73.png)\\n\\nFIGURE 8.

The overall gain A must be negative in order to close the feedback loop, the input impedance must be high to maintain low current noise and good gain accuracy, but the gain ratio must be set with very  low  value  resistors  to  maintain  good  voltage  noise. Using  a  two-amplifier  configuration  (noninverting  for  high impedance  plus  inverting  for  negative  feedback  reasons) results in excessive phase lag and stability problems when the loop is closed. The VCA2612 uses a patented architecture  that  achieves  these  requirements,  with  the  additional benefits of low power dissipation and differential signal handling at both input and output.\\n\\nFor greatest flexibility and lowest noise, the user may wish to shape the frequency response of the LNP. The COMP1 and COMP2 pins for each channel (pins 10 and 11 for channel A, pins 26 and 27 for channel B) correspond to the drains of Q 3 and Q8 in Figure 4. A capacitor placed between these pins will  create  a  single-pole  low-pass  response,  in  which  the effective R of the RC time constant is approximately 186 Ω .\\n## COMPENSATION WHEN USING ACTIVE FEEDBACK\\n\\nThe typical  open-loop  gain  versus  frequency  characteristic for  the  LNP  is  shown  in  Figure  9.  The  -dB  bandwidth  is 3 approximately 180MHz and the phase response is such that when  feedback  is  applied  the  LNP  will  exhibit  a  peaked response or might even oscillate. One method for compensating for this undesirable behavior is to place a compensation capacitor at the input to the LNP, as shown in Figure 10. This method is effective when the desired - 3dB bandwidth is much less than the open-loop bandwidth of the LNP. This compensation technique also allows the total compensation capacitor  to  include  any  stray  or  cable  capacitance  that  is\\n\\n![Image](VCA2612Y_slash_250__TexasInstruments_183_componentsearchengine-with-image-refs_artifacts/image_000067_57f98de4ad46ab10631102aabfd0b5e731834056483653588f2c5707a0ce99ed.png)\\n\\nFIGURE 9.

Equation 4 relates the bandwidth to the various impedances that are connected to the LNP.\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n## LNP OUTPUT BUFFER\\n\\nThe differential LNP output is buffered by wideband class AB voltage followers which are designed to drive low impedance loads.  This  is  necessary  to  maintain  LNP  gain  accuracy, since  the  VCA  input  exhibits  gain-dependent  input  impedance. The buffers are also useful when the LNP output is brought out to drive external filters or other signal processing circuitry.  Good  distortion  performance  is  maintained  with buffer loads as low as 135 Ω .  As mentioned previously, the buffer  inputs  are  AC-coupled  to  the  LNP  outputs  with  a 3.6kHz high-pass characteristic, and the DC common-mode level is maintained at the correct V CM  for compatibility with the VCA input.\", \"## VOLTAGE-CONTROLLED ATTENUATOR (VCA)-DETAIL\\n\\nThe VCA is designed to have a dB-linear attenuation characteristic,  i.e.  the  gain  loss  in  dB  is  constant  for  each  equal increment of the VCACNTL control voltage. See Figure  11  for  a  diagram  of  the  VCA.  The  attenuator  is essentially a variable voltage divider consisting of one series input  resistor,  R S ,  and  ten  identical  shunt  FETs,  placed  in parallel  and  controlled  by  sequentially  activated  clipping amplifiers.  Each  clipping  amplifier  can  be  thought  of  as  a specialized voltage comparator with a soft transfer characteristic and well-controlled output limit voltages. The reference voltages V1 through V10 are equally spaced over the 0V to 3.0V  control  voltage  range.  As  the  control  voltage  rises through the input range of each clipping amplifier, the amplifier output will rise from 0V (FET completely ON) to V CM - V T (FET nearly OFF), where V CM  is the common source voltage and  V T is  the  threshold  voltage  of  the  FET.  As  each  FET approaches its OFF state and the control voltage continues to  rise,  the  next  clipping  amplifier/FET  combination  takes over for the next portion of the piecewise-linear attenuation characteristic. Thus, low control voltages have most of the FETs  turned  ON,  while  high  control  voltages  have  most turned OFF. Each FET acts to decrease the shunt resistance of  the  voltage  divider  formed  by  R S   and  the  parallel  FET network.\\n\\nThe attenuator is comprised of two sections, with five parallel clipping amplifier/FET combinations in each. Special reference circuitry is provided so that the (V CM - V T ) limit voltage will track temperature and IC process variations, minimizing the effects on the attenuator control characteristic.\\n\\nIn  addition  to  the  analog  VCA CNTL   gain  setting  input,  the attenuator architecture provides digitally programmable adjustment in eight steps, via the three Maximum Gain Setting (MGS)  bits.  These  adjust  the  maximum  achievable  gain\\n\\nFIGURE 10.

This function is accomplished by providing multiple FET sub-elements for each of the Q1 to Q10 FET shunt elements shown in Figure 11. In the simplified diagram of Figure 12, each shunt FET is shown as two sub-elements, Q NA  and Q NB . Selector switches, driven by the MGS bits, activate either or both of the sub-element FETs to adjust the maximum R ON  and thus achieve the stepped attenuation options.\\n\\nThe VCA can be used to process either differential or singleended  signals.  Fully  differential  operation  will  reduce  2ndharmonic distortion by about 10dB for full-scale signals.\\n\\n![Image](VCA2612Y_slash_250__TexasInstruments_183_componentsearchengine-with-image-refs_artifacts/image_000071_ebf753de73843143d34d2be36c92493176e9c7b0ebd4dc2ee33f11a499ff0cea.png)\\n\\nFIGURE 12.

At large attenuation factors (i.e., low gain settings),  the  impedance  will  approach  the  series  resistor value of approximately 135 Ω .\\n\\nAs with the LNP stage, the VCA output is AC-coupled into the PGA. This means that the attenuation-dependent DC common-mode voltage will not propagate into the PGA, and so the PGA's DC output level will remain constant.\\n\\nFinally,  note  that  the  VCA CNTL   input  consists  of  FET  gate inputs. This provides very high impedance and ensures that multiple VCA2612 devices may be connected in parallel with no significant loading effects. The nominal voltage range for the  VCA CNTL   input  spans  from  0V  to  3V.  Over  driving  this input ( ≤ 5V) does not affect the performance.\\n## OVERLOAD RECOVERY CIRCUITRY-DETAIL\\n\\nWith a maximum overall gain of 70dB, the VCA2612 is prone to signal overloading. Such a condition may occur in either the  LNP  or  the  PGA  depending  on  the  various  gain  and attenuation settings available. The LNP is designed to produce  low-distortion  outputs  as  large  as  1V PP   single-ended (2VPP   differential).  Therefore  the  maximum  input  signal  for linear operation is 2V PP divided by the LNP differential gain setting. Clamping circuits in the LNP ensure that larger input amplitudes will exhibit symmetrical clipping and short recovery times. The VCA itself, being basically a voltage divider, is intrinsically free of overload conditions. However, the PGA post-amplifier is vulnerable to sudden overload, particularly at high gain settings. Rapid overload recovery is essential in many  signal  processing  applications  such  as  ultrasound imaging. A special comparator circuit is provided at the PGA input  which  detects  overrange  signals  (detection  level  dependent on PGA gain setting). When the signal exceeds the comparator input threshold, the VCA output is blocked and an appropriate fixed DC level is substituted, providing fast and clean overload recovery. The basic architecture is shown in  Figure  13.  Both  high  and  low  overrange  conditions  are sensed and corrected by this circuit.\\n\\nFigures  14  and  15  show  typical  overload  recovery  waveforms with MGS = 100, for VCA + PGA minimum gain (0dB) and maximum gain (36dB), respectively. LNP gain is set to 25dB in both cases.\\n\\n![Image](VCA2612Y_slash_250__TexasInstruments_183_componentsearchengine-with-image-refs_artifacts/image_000073_b4b1f87db2432142003f23fee8a24d96f828bfb8cf344b862448c9315a1630a9.png)\\n\\nFIGURE 13.

The ultrasound signal  flow  begins  when  a  large  signal  is  applied  to  a transducer,  which  converts  electrical  energy  to  acoustic energy. It is not uncommon for the amplitude of the electrical signal that is applied to the transducer to be ± 50V or greater. To  prevent  damage,  it  is  necessary  to  place  a  protection circuit between the transducer and the VCA2612, as shown in Figure 16. Care must be taken to prevent any signal from turning  the  ESD  diodes  on.  Turning  on  the  ESD  diodes inside the VCA2612 could cause the input coupling capacitor (C C) to charge to the wrong value.\\n\\nFIGURE 16. VCA2612 Diode Bridge Protection Circuit.\\n\\n![Image](VCA2612Y_slash_250__TexasInstruments_183_componentsearchengine-with-image-refs_artifacts/image_000077_bd64d851edda041082ca5249516b0467712f11fce244cb9e20b1ea703e428c18.png)\\n## PGA POST-AMPLIFIER-DETAIL\\n\\nFigure 17 shows a simplified circuit diagram of the PGA block. As described previously, the PGA gain is programmed with the same MGS bits which control the VCA maximum attenuation factor. Specifically, the PGA gain at each MGS setting is the inverse (reciprocal) of the maximum VCA attenuation at that setting. Therefore, the VCA + PGA overall gain will always be  0dB  (unity)  when  the  analog  VCA CNTL   input  is  set  to  0V (= maximum attenuation). For VCA CNTL  = 3V (no attenuation), the VCA + PGA gain will be controlled by the programmed PGA gain (24dB to 45dB in 3dB steps).\\n\\nFor clarity,  the  gain  and  attenuation factors are detailed in Table III.\\n\\nTABLE III. MGS Settings.\\n\\n|   MGS SETTING | ATTENUATOR GAIN VCA CNTL = 0V to 3V   | DIFFERENTIAL PGA GAIN   | ATTENUATOR + DIFF.

The circuitry associated with the voltage to current converter is similar to that previously described for the LNP, with the addition of eight selectable PGA gain-setting resistor combinations (controlled by the MGS bits) in place of the fixed resistor network used in the LNP. Low input noise is also a requirement of the PGA design due to the large amount of signal attenuation which can be inserted between the LNP and the PGA. At minimum VCA attenuation (used for small input  signals)  the  LNP  noise  dominates;  at  maximum  VCA attenuation  (large  input  signals)  the  PGA  noise  dominates. Note that if the PGA output is used single-ended, the apparent gain will be 6dB lower.\\n\\n![Image](VCA2612Y_slash_250__TexasInstruments_183_componentsearchengine-with-image-refs_artifacts/image_000078_c62897a4dd0aa8757d05576352c59b289dab6d072ae2418572c802f290081b8c.png)\\n\\nFIGURE 17.
