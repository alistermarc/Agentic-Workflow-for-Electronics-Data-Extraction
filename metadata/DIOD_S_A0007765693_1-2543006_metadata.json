See test circuit and waveforms.\\n- 2. This parameter is guaranteed but not tested on propagation delays.\\n- 3. The switch contributes no propagation delay other than the RC delay of the on-resistance of the switch and the load capacitance. The time constant for the switch alone is of the order of 0.30ns for 10pF load. Because this time constant is much smaller than the rise/fall times of typical driving signals, it adds very little propagation delay to the system. Propagation delay of the switch when used in a system is determined by the driving circuit on the driving side of the switch and its interaction with the load on the driven side.\\n## Test Circuit for Electrical Characteristics\\n\\n![Image](DIOD_S_A0007765693_1-2543006-with-image-refs_artifacts/image_000014_17760e7aed65d4892a8a1c97c002aa7bff1a6f94f5622ac3a750950ed70d8299.png)\\n## Notes:\\n\\n- 1.

For example given a +3.3V supply, EN may be driven LOW to OV and HIGH to 3.6V. Driving EN Rail-to-Rail\\\" minimizes power consumption.\\n## Hot Insertion\\n\\nFor Datacom and Telecom applications that have ten or more volts passing through the backplane, a high voltage from the power supply can be seen at the device input pins during hot insertion. The PI3CH360 devices have maximum limits of 6V and 120mA for 20ns. If the power is higher, applied for a longer time, or repeatedly reaches the maximum limits, the devices can be damaged.\\n## Part Marking\\n\\nL Package\\n\\n![Image](DIOD_S_A0007765693_1-2543006-with-image-refs_artifacts/image_000020_d638145e316ac5d69c4ea62eff9b5625d6aa86bee6884b7399d77d442d51d684.png)\\n\\nZ: Fixed Code Y: Year W: Workweek 1st X: Assembly Site Code 2nd X: Fab Site Code Bar above “I” means Fab3 of MGN Bar above fab code means Cu wire\\n\\n![Image](DIOD_S_A0007765693_1-2543006-with-image-refs_artifacts/image_000021_6e578263ee0437c1109a65c2de01ba6c8db02025d58c9d2e4403312dec0eb1cc.png)\\n\\nZ: Fixed Code Y: Year W: Workweek ist X: Assembly Site Code 2nd X: Fab Site Code Bar above fab code means Cu wire Bar above “I” means Fab3 of MGN\", \"## ZHD Package\\n\\nTop mark is not available at this time.
